## Introduction to the book
There’s a lot of excitement about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. We hear about startups, 
investments,
meetups, and even buying pizza with Bitcoin. Optimists claim that Bitcoin will fundamentally 
alter
payments, economics, and even politics around the world. Pessimists claim Bitcoin is inherently
broken and will suffer an inevitable and spectacular collapse.
Underlying these differing views is significant confusion about what Bitcoin is and how it 
works. We
wrote this book to help cut through the hype and get to the core of what makes Bitcoin 
unique.
To really understand what is special about Bitcoin, we need to understand how it works at a 
technical
level. Bitcoin truly is a new technology and we can only get so far by explaining it through 
simple
analogies to past technologies.
We’ll assume that you have a basic understanding of computer science — how computers work,
data
structures and algorithms, and some programming experience. If you’re an undergraduate or
graduate student of computer science, a software developer, an entrepreneur, or a 
technology
hobbyist, this textbook is for you.
In this series of eleven chapters, we’ll address the important questions about Bitcoin. How 
does
Bitcoin work? What makes it different? How secure are your bitcoins? How anonymous are 
Bitcoin
users? What applications can we build using Bitcoin as a platform? Can cryptocurrencies be
regulated? If we were designing a new cryptocurrency today, what would we change? What 
might the
future hold?
Each chapter has a series of homework questions to help you understand these questions at a 
deeper
level. We highly recommend you work through them. In addition, there is a series of five
programming assignments in which you’ll implement various components of Bitcoin in simplified
models. If you’re an auditory learner, most of the material of this book is also available as a
series of
video lectures. You should also supplement your learning with information you can find online
including the Bitcoin wiki, forums, and research papers, and by interacting with your peers 
and the
Bitcoin community.
